The kernel, sometimes called the wheat berry, is the seed from which the
wheat plant grows. About 80% of the kernel weight is the endosperm that
is the source of white flour.

The dataset describes kernels of three different varieties of wheat:
Kama (1), Rosa (2) and Canadian (3); 70 elements each, randomly selected for
the experiment. The internal kernel structure was visualised using a soft
X-ray technique. Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels were
made using the GRAINS package.

Attribute description:
- area (A)
- perimeter (P)
- compactness - C = 4*pi*A/P^2
- kernel length
- kernel width
- asymmetry coefficient
- length of kernel groove
